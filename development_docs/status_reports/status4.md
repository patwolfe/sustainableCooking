What we accomplished:
1. Selecting ingredients Form

To-do:
1. Data Scraper
2. Send ingredients to produce list of recipes
3. Components
    -Button that gets highlighted to indicate selections
    -Info display for each recipe (when selected on recipe form)
4. Make things look pretty

# Comments by Ming
* Do you need to use React?
* "Team members have set up things sufficiently on Windows machines." => this is actually really good to see.  The reason: getting all the ducks in the row and consistent working environments
* "working form for user input -list component that will ultimately store all the recipes retrieved -finished scraper for getting local foods for the user's location." => seems like this was done (from report 2)
* "Send ingredients to produce list of recipes" => top priority
