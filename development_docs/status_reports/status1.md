-Status report:
 -
 -1. We began working on the server and the front end 
 -   for the project. We have part of the GET request
 -   for retrieving local foods done and have 
 -   created a basic react component for the 
 -   form for the user to fill out with their information
 -
 -2. The biggest issue we encountered was getting 
 -   things set up for team members on Windows machines.
 -   Also, learning how to use ReactJS as none of us 
 -   have extensive experience with it. 
 -
 -3. We decided to have just one page for inputting 
 -   locations and generating the list of recipes.
 -
 -4. By the next week we hope to have a working 
 -   form for user input, a list component that 
 -   will ultimately store all the recipes 
 -   retrieved, and a finished scraper for getting
 -   local foods for the user's location.
